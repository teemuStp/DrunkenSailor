For compiling the program , use gfortran command: 

gfortran mtfort90.f95 SAW.f95 sailormover.f95 averages.f95 main.f95

This compiles all neccessary module.o files into lower modules and finally to the main program.

Input paramaters for running the code are given as command line arguments in form:

./a.out numberOfSimulations saveToFile? SAW?

First argument 	MUST BE AN INTEGER, otherwise the progrmam won't run!
Second has to be "yes" for program to save data to file
Third argument has to be "yes" for program tu run SAW-simulation, otherwise it will simulate ordinary walk

If Arguments are absent:

First argument absent sets number of simulations to zero

Second argument absent sets program NOT to save to a file
	
Third argument absent sets walk to ordinary walk


To change the random number generator igrnd() seed, go to file mtfort90.95 line 125, and change integer value of Defaultd.
